This is just a fun project right now but I've been taking my time on it, as I've been busy. Right now I've realized that I need a way to identify clients by a ID number (probably gonna use a hashmap) so that you can interact with them from the CLI that I'm working on creating. this will be a bit tricky but I'll get to it sooner or later.
